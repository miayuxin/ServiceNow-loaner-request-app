# ServiceNow-loaner-request-app

## Purpose
Develop a scoped application to manage a loaner equipment program.

## Business Problem 
Loaner Requests for laptops, mobile phones, and projectors have been managed by e-mail, spreadsheets, and personal contracts. 
These requests have not been easy to track or report on. 
Some requests have even gone unifilled. As a result, not only is the mismanagement of Loaner Requests dissatisfying to the employees, 
but also expensive for the company. 

The Loaner Request application will manage and track Loaner Requests through easy-to-use user interface that is consistent with other corporate software. 

## Desired Outcome 
- A single location where employee can submit Loaner Requests for laptops, mobile phones, and projectors. 
- Accurate and timely completion of all tasks necessary to fulfill Loaner Requests; fewer missed deadlines. 
- Retire the spreadsheets currently used to manage Loaner Requests. 
- Improve requestor satisfaction with process and request fulfillment. 
- Automation of all steps. 

## Process
- Build an app on ServiceNow's internal platform with JavaScript.
- Create client scripts and system properties; defined business rules and access control rules; designed the operation flow based on the requirements, 
and deploy it on the ServiceNow store.
